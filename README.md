# Convulation Neural Network
CNN or Convulation Neural Network, I've created a CNN architecure, where I added 4 CRP, 1 flatten and 6 hidden layers. I've got 89% Accuracy with this architecture.

But what is CNN?

Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNNs) are a category of Neural Networks that have proven very effective in areas such as image recognition and classification. ConvNets have been successful in identifying faces, objects and traffic signs apart from powering vision in robots and self driving cars.

Number of class we have is 7 (7 members of the family)
Now, I've use my dad's image, to see the accuracy.

{'big_brother': 0, 'me': 1, 'dad': 2, 'grandmother': 3, 'sis': 4, 'mom': 5, 'younger_brother': 6}

prediction : [[0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
As you can see, this model is good. Model successfully recognised my dad's image.
